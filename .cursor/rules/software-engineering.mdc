# Software Engineering Best Practices

## Code Organization

- Separate concerns: agents, tasks, tools, and configuration in logical sections
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- Group related imports together
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project

## Error Handling and Resilience

- Implement proper try-catch blocks for external API calls
- Handle rate limiting and API timeouts gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Add retry logic for transient failures
- Validate inputs before processing

## Configuration Management

- Centralize configuration values (model names, file paths, etc.)
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings
- Make parameters easily adjustable without code changes
- Document configuration options and their effects

## Testing and Validation

- Test individual components before integrating into the crew
- Validate data formats and schemas
- Test with small datasets before running full operations
- Implement checkpoints for long-running processes
- Keep backup copies of working configurations

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor token usage and API costs
- Implement efficient data processing patterns
- Use appropriate batch sizes for operations
- Clear unused variables and objects to free memory
- Profile resource-heavy operations

## Version Control Best Practices

- Commit working versions before major changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep sensitive configuration separate from code
- Create branches for experimental features
- Tag stable releases

## File Management

- Use consistent directory structures (`output/`, `output_charts/`, `output/reports/`)
- Implement proper file path handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Clean up temporary files after processing
- Validate file existence before operations
- Use appropriate file naming conventions

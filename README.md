# Multi-Agent Market Research System

A sophisticated multi-agent research system for enterprise LLM market analysis using CrewAI and optimized Gemini models.

## 🎯 **NEW: OPTIMIZED FOR MINIMAL API USAGE**

This system has been **optimized for minimal Gemini API usage** with **75-80% reduction** in token consumption while maintaining high-quality market analysis capabilities.

### **Key Optimizations:**
- **7 tasks → 4 tasks** (43% reduction)
- **4 agents → 3 agents** (25% reduction)
- **Ultra-minimal token limits**: 150-300 tokens per task
- **Simplified JSON outputs** with focused structure
- **Expected usage**: 400-600 tokens per run (vs 2000-3000 before)

## 🚀 Features

### **Multi-Agent Architecture**
- **Archivist**: Expert in finding relevant market data
- **Shadow**: Expert in dissecting competitor strategies  
- **Nexus**: Expert in concise and actionable reporting

### **Optimized Workflow**
1. **Market Segment Identification** (ultra-minimal)
2. **Research Collection** (minimal)
3. **Competitor Analysis** (minimal)
4. **Executive Summary** (synthesis)

### **Structured Outputs**
All tasks produce structured JSON outputs with specific schemas for efficient multi-agent workflows:
- Market segments with descriptions and sizes
- Research sources with key findings
- Competitor profiles with strengths and positions
- Executive summaries with insights and recommendations

## 🛠️ Installation

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Google API key (for Gemini model)
- SerperDev API key (for web search)
- Firecrawl API key (for web scraping)

### **Setup**
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Multi-AI-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here
   ```

## 🎯 Usage

### **Quick Start**
```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. Load environment variables from `.env.local`
2. Test Gemini integration
3. Create optimized agents and tasks
4. Execute market analysis workflow
5. Generate structured results

### **Expected Output**
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "key_insights": [
      "The LLM market is experiencing rapid growth...",
      "Enterprise AI adoption is increasing...",
      "Customer Service & Support and Content Creation & Marketing segments..."
    ],
    "competitive_landscape": "The competitive landscape is dominated by Microsoft and Google...",
    "recommendations": [
      "Prioritize investments in Customer Service & Support...",
      "Strengthen partnerships with key technology providers...",
      "Focus on differentiating through specialized solutions..."
    ]
  }
}
```

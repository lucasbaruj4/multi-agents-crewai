# Execution Environment Rules

## NEVER Execute Code Locally in Cursor

**Rule #1:** Code is written and developed in Cursor, but ONLY executed in Google Colab
**Rule #2:** Do not run any Python scripts, install packages, or execute commands in Cursor's terminal for this project
**Rule #3:** Cursor is for writing, editing, refactoring, and code organization ONLY
**Rule #4:** All package installations (!pip install) should only happen in Colab cells
**Rule #5:** File operations, API calls, and model loading should only occur in Colab environment

## Colab-Specific Considerations

- Remember Colab sessions are temporary - files will be lost when runtime disconnects
- Use Google Drive mounting for persistent storage when needed
- Be aware of Colab's resource limits (GPU hours, RAM, disk space)
- Test resource-intensive operations in small batches first
- Always save important outputs to Drive or download them

## Development Workflow

1. **Write code in Cursor** - Use Cursor for all code development, refactoring, and organization
2. **Copy to Colab** - Transfer code blocks to Google Colab for execution
3. **Execute in Colab** - Run all Python code, install packages, and perform operations in Colab
4. **Test and iterate** - Use Colab for testing, then return to Cursor for improvements
